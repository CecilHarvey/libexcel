libexcel is a C based library for creating Excel XLS spreadsheets.
It is heavily based on Spreadsheet::WriteExcel by John McNamara.

BUILDING
===========================================================================
Simply change to the src directory and execute make (or gmake on BSD
systems). BSD make is currently not supported you must use GNU make.

This will build a static library called libexcel.a
You can then change into the tests directory to build some sample apps that
utilize the library.

On Windows you can use mingw32 or the lcc-win32 compiler system.
You may need to alter the makefile to set paths to your compiler.
